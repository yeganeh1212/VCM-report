# Virtual Cell Model 

The Virtual Cell Model (VCM) software package is a Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation software. The core concept of VCM is to get particle coordinates and the potentials between them and solve Newton's equations to calculate the dynamics of the system.

VCM's design focuses on simulating linear chains of particles (such as long polymers), particles on 2D triangular meshes (vesicles), and particles on 3D Meshes (solid objects). The combination of these inputs can be used to build any general system for simulation porpuses. With OpenMM as the engine, VCM can fully utilise the resources of the host machine (Multiple CPU cores and/or GPUs).

research question :

Use vcm for simulation of interaction between a lipid membrane and two nanoparticles and measure the change of energy and position of the system.
